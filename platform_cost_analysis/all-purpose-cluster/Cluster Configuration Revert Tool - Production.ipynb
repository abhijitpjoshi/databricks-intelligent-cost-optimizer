    "# 🔄 Cluster Configuration Revert Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a production-ready tool to revert cluster configurations to their state **before a selected batch update**. It uses the selected batch as a **reference point in time** and reverts ALL clusters in the environment to their configuration before that reference date.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Time-based Revert**: Select any batch as a reference point - all clusters revert to their state BEFORE that date\n",
    "* ✅ **Complete Configuration Restore**: Restores instance types, policies, security modes, AWS attributes, elastic disk, auto-termination, and all other settings\n",
    "* ✅ **Cross-Workspace Support**: Works across different workspaces using Service Principal authentication\n",
    "* ✅ **Environment Selector**: Supports dev, qa, uat, and prod environments\n",
    "* ✅ **Batch History**: View all batch updates with labels and statistics\n",
    "* ✅ **Comprehensive Validation**: Pre-execution checks for authentication, compute, and environment readiness\n",
    "* ✅ **Detailed Reporting**: Execution summary with success/failure tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Environment** (dev/qa/uat/prod) → Determines which catalog and workspace to use\n",
    "2. **View Batch History** → Shows all batch updates in the selected environment\n",
    "3. **Select Reference Batch** → Choose which batch date to use as the revert reference point\n",
    "4. **Analyze Impact** → Shows ALL clusters in the environment and what will be reverted\n",
    "5. **Execute Revert** → Restores all clusters to their state BEFORE the reference date\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference Point Logic:**\n",
    "* The selected batch is a **reference point in time**, not a filter\n",
    "* ALL clusters that have been updated in the environment will be reverted\n",
    "* Each cluster reverts to its last configuration BEFORE the reference date\n",
    "* Each cluster's previous config may be from different dates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "* You select batch \"2025-12-10_20-11\" as reference\n",
    "* Cluster A was last configured on Dec 9 → reverts to Dec 9 state\n",
    "* Cluster B was last configured on Nov 15 → reverts to Nov 15 state\n",
    "* Cluster C was configured on Dec 11 → reverts to its state before Dec 10 20:11\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Access:\n",
    "* ✅ Read access to `{catalog}.billing_forecast.cluster_update_log` table\n",
    "* ✅ Read access to `system.compute.clusters` table\n",
    "* ✅ Service Principal credentials in `sp-oauth` secret scope (for cross-workspace)\n",
    "* ✅ Classic compute cluster (required for cross-workspace API calls)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Secrets:\n",
    "* `sp-oauth` scope with keys:\n",
    "  * `client` - Service Principal Client ID\n",
    "  * `secret` - Service Principal Client Secret\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attach to Classic Compute** (e.g., \"Abhijit Joshi's multinode Cluster\")\n",
    "2. **Run Cell 2**: Select environment (dev/qa/uat/prod)\n",
    "3. **Run Cell 3**: View all batch updates in the environment\n",
    "4. **Run Cell 4**: Select which batch to use as reference point\n",
    "5. **Run Cell 5**: Analyze impact - see what will be reverted\n",
    "6. **Run Cell 6**: Execute the complete revert\n",
    "7. **Verify**: Check target workspace to confirm configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safety Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🛡️ **Pre-execution validation** of authentication and compute\n",
    "* 🛡️ **Detailed preview** of all changes before execution\n",
    "* 🛡️ **Per-cluster error handling** - one failure doesn't stop others\n",
    "* 🛡️ **Comprehensive logging** - tracks success/failure for each cluster\n",
    "* 🛡️ **Audit trail** - all operations logged with timestamps and users\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **This tool reverts ALL clusters in the environment, not just those in the selected batch**\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Each cluster reverts to its state BEFORE the reference date**\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Always verify results in the target workspace after execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Cluster policies must exist and be accessible for successful revert**\n",

    "#### 1. Policy Not Found Error\n",

    "* Cluster policy doesn't exist in target workspace\n",
    "* Policy was deleted or renamed\n",
    "* Service Principal doesn't have access to policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "* Verify policy exists: Go to Compute → Policies in target workspace\n",
    "* Check Service Principal has `CAN_USE` permission on policy\n",
    "* If policy is missing, recreate it or remove policy requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. AWS Attributes Validation Error\n",
    "**Symptom**: `Invalid AWS attributes` or `Policy validation failed`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causes:**\n",
    "* AWS attributes from previous state incompatible with current policy\n",
    "* Policy requirements changed since previous configuration\n",
    "* Instance profile or availability zone restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "* Check policy definition for AWS attribute requirements\n",
    "* Verify instance profile ARN is valid\n",
    "* Ensure availability zone is allowed by policy\n",
    "* Check `first_on_demand`, `spot_bid_price_percent` settings\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Permission Denied Error\n",
    "**Symptom**: `User does not have permission to edit cluster`\n",

    "* Service Principal lacks `CAN_MANAGE` permission on cluster\n",
    "* Workspace-level permissions insufficient\n",
    "* Secret scope access issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions:**\n",
    "* Grant Service Principal `CAN_MANAGE` on clusters\n",

    "* Verify `sp-oauth` secret scope is accessible\n",
    "* Test authentication in Cell 3\n",

    "#### 4. Cluster Not Found or Terminated\n",
    "**Symptom**: `Cluster XXX not found` or `Cannot edit terminated cluster`\n",

    "**Causes:**\n",
    "* Cluster was deleted after batch update\n",
    "* Cluster is in TERMINATED state\n",
    "* Cluster ID changed\n",

    "* Verify cluster is not permanently deleted\n",
    "* Skip deleted clusters - they don't need revert\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "#### 5. Cross-Workspace Authentication Failed\n",
    "**Symptom**: `OAuth authentication failed` or `401 Unauthorized`\n",

    "* Service Principal credentials invalid or expired\n",
    "* Secret scope not accessible\n",
